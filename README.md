# ScubaVision

This is video streaming development code for the Oregon Statue University Robotics Club (OSURC) entry ROV for the 2018 MATE ROV competetition.  It is not yet in a distributable state, and will likely not be until after the competition.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Host:
	OpenCV 3.3.1 (and its deps)
		You can use the install script from master for help setting up OpenCV the way we did

Jetson:
	Jetson TK1
		-> Camera (tested on PS Eye)
		-> Jetpack 21.5 (R21, Rev5.0)
		-> Grinch Kernel
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
